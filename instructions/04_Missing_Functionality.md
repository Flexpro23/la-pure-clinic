# Missing Functionality for Full Operation

While the frontend components provide a user interface for a simulation creation process, significant pieces are missing for the application to be fully functional, especially concerning the `new-simulation-form.tsx` and its intended purpose.

## 1. Backend System & API

This is the most critical missing element. A robust backend is required to handle:

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Securely manage user accounts and access control.
*   **Database:**
    *   Store client information (name, age, notes, etc.).
    *   Store image metadata and links/paths to stored images.
    *   Store selected hairline and hairstyle choices.
    *   Store generated simulation results and their association with clients/cases.
    *   Manage data for other application modules (cases, diagnoses, etc.).
*   **API Endpoints:** The frontend needs well-defined API endpoints for:
    *   Submitting the new simulation form data (client info, image references, selections).
    *   Uploading images (handling file storage).
    *   Fetching dynamic data (e.g., if hairline/hairstyle options were to be moved to the backend).
    *   Initiating the simulation process.
    *   Retrieving simulation results or status.
    *   All other CRUD operations for the application's modules (auth, cases, dashboard data, etc.).

## 2. Real Image Upload & Storage

*   The `ImageUpload` component currently handles client-side file selection.
*   **Missing:** The actual mechanism to:
    *   Transmit the selected image file(s) to a server.
    *   Store the image file(s) securely and persistently (e.g., cloud storage like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or on-server storage).

## 3. Core Simulation Engine/Logic

*   The frontend collects inputs for the simulation, but the actual generation of the simulated hairstyle is absent.
*   **Missing:** A backend service or integrated module that:
    *   Takes the client's image and selected hairline/hairstyle as input.
    *   Applies image processing and AI/algorithmic logic to generate a visual simulation.
    *   Outputs the result in a format the frontend can display (e.g., a new image URL, image data).

## 4. Dynamic Data Population

*   **`HairlineSelector`**: Currently uses hardcoded hairline options.
*   **`HairstylePreview`**: Currently uses hardcoded hairstyle options.
*   **Missing (for scalability/manageability):** A backend mechanism to serve these options, allowing them to be updated without frontend code changes (e.g., via a CMS or admin interface connected to the backend database).

## 5. Display of Actual Simulation Results

*   The `HairstylePreview` component has a static placeholder for "Original Image" and "Simulated Result."
*   **Missing:**
    *   Logic to fetch or receive the actual original image uploaded by the user for display in the preview.
    *   Logic to fetch or receive and display the actual generated simulation image/data from the backend.

## 6. Comprehensive Error Handling & User Feedback

*   While basic `isLoading` states are present, a production application would need more detailed error handling for:
    *   API request failures (network issues, server errors).
    *   Image upload failures.
    *   Simulation processing errors.
    *   Clearer user feedback messages for various states.

## 7. Backend for Other Application Modules

Beyond the simulation form, the other inferred parts of the application (`auth`, `case`, `dashboard`, `diagnosis`, `onboarding`, `planner`, `settings`) all imply significant backend logic and database interactions that are not present in the analyzed frontend codebase.
