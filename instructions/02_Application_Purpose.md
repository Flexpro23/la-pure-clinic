# Application Purpose

## Overall Application

The directory structure (`auth`, `case`, `dashboard`, `diagnosis`, `onboarding`, `planner`, `settings`, `simulation`) and component names strongly suggest this is a comprehensive web application designed for a **clinic or medical practice, likely specializing in hair restoration, dermatology, or a similar aesthetic field.**

The application appears to aim to provide functionality for:

*   **User Authentication:** (`auth/`)
*   **Patient/Client Onboarding:** (`onboarding/`)
*   **Case Management:** (`case/`) - Managing individual patient or client cases.
*   **Diagnosis:** (`diagnosis/`) - Recording or managing diagnoses.
*   **Treatment Planning/Scheduling:** (`planner/`)
*   **Hair/Procedure Simulation:** (`simulation/`) - Visualizing potential outcomes.
*   **User Dashboard:** (`dashboard/`) - Providing an overview for users/practitioners.
*   **Application/User Settings:** (`settings/`)

## `new-simulation-form.tsx` Component

The `components/simulation/new-simulation-form.tsx` component serves a specific role within this larger application:

*   **Purpose:** To allow a user (likely a practitioner) to create a new hair simulation for a client.
*   **Workflow:** It guides the user through a multi-step tabbed interface:
    1.  **Client Information:** Collects the client's name (required), age, and notes.
    2.  **Image Upload:** Allows uploading a "frontal image" of the client.
    3.  **Hairline & Hairstyle Selection:**
        *   The user selects a hairline type from a predefined list.
        *   Based on the selected hairline, a list of recommended hairstyles is presented for selection.
*   **Outcome:** Upon completion, the form currently *simulates* an API call and redirects to a dynamically generated dashboard URL (e.g., `/dashboard/sim-xxx`). In a functional application, it would submit the collected data and image to a backend for actual processing and storage.
